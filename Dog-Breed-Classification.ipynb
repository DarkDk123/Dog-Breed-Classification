    "# üê∂ Dog Breeds Classification Using Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever seen a dog and wondered what breed it is?\n",
    "\n",
    "I have. And then someone says, *\"it's a BullDog\"* and you think, how did they know that?\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project we're going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll be using data from the [Kaggle dog breed identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview). It consists of a collection of **10,000+ labelled images** of **120 different dog breeds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of problem is called **multi-class image classification**. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-class image classification is an important problem because it's the same kind of technology Tesla uses in their self-driving cars or Airbnb uses in automatically adding information to their listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the most important step in a deep learning problem is **getting the data ready** *(turning it into numbers)*, that's what we're going to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **We're going to go through the following TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow:** üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Problem Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to identify a Dog's breed based on it's image, classifying a dog into almost 120 different classes of breeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Get data ready for Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A. Downloading and storing data (download from Kaggle, store, import):**\\\n",
    "- **B. Prepare the data *(preprocessing, the 3 sets i.e. train, test, validation And  Separating X & y).***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Choose and fit/train a model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the type of problem, either using a pretrained (TensorFlow Hub or other) model, or training one from scratch.\\\n",
    "([TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), `tf.keras.applications`, [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [EarlyStopping](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Evaluating a model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Making predictions on **validation set**, comparing them with the ground truth labels, and according moving further.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Improve the model through experimentation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with few 1000 images, make sure it works then increase the number of images accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Save, sharing and reloading your model**\n",
    "Saving the model once **reasonable results** are achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting our workspace ready\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, since we'll be using **TensorFlow 2.x** and **TensorFlow Hub (TensorFlow Hub)**. So make sure all the packages are installed as in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt)."
